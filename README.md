# Back to the Future Quiz (MS3_python)
## Introduction
Back to the Future Quiz (MS3_python) is a browser-based game built in Python. It is a fun quiz game focusing on the Back To The Future movie franchise, and also my favourite movie of all time.

This game utilises the Code Institute Python template, as it was developed in Python for use in the terminal. This makes it available within a web browser.
